# Configuration YAML file, type LAYOUT
# template v.2025-11-12

# Arrangement of optical components and distances between them in meters
# distance = 0 can be omitted
# use times > 1 for multiple propagations through a sub-system
- go: L1 >> 0.5 >> P1 >> 0.5 >> L1 >> P2
  times: 3

# Multiple "go-times" subsystems are allowed
# propagation through sub-system is executed in order of
# their appearance in this configuration file
- go: 10 >> P3
  times: 1

# NOTE: Last optic in the layout must be a probe (type P)
# NOTE: Distance from an amplifier section to the next non-amplifier
#       optic must be longer than the pulse time range
