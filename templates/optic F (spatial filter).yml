# Filter type (ND/APERTURE/MASK/SIN/GAUSS/FREEFORM)
filter: SIN

# if filter == ND: transmittance (0...1)
#T: 0.75

# if filter == APERTURE: aperture radius, m
# APERTURE is useful when we don't want to resample the beam (keep semiDia)
#R: 10e-3

# if filter == MASK: mask (opaque disk) radius, m
#R: 10e-3

# if filter == SIN: distance from center where transmittance starts to decrease, m
# and width of the ring were transmittance decreases (transmittance becomes 0 at R+w)
# if w is omitted, it's calculated as semiDia-R (transmittance becomes 0 at semiDia)
